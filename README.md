Hello and welcome to my page, if you're reading this, you may be interested in my dissertation work, a fascinating study that is soon to be
published on frontiers.org 📰

In my dissertation, I aimed to create an ML model that was capable of analysing road surface vibrational data (from an e-scooter) 
in real time and classifying this data, with potential uses of improving rider comfort and safety for urban micromobility. 📜

I created 36 different iterations of models using 3 ML algorithms (SVM+K-means clustering, RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost)
using different parameter tuning and data splitting strategies for training and testing. 🧑‍💻

After iterating through the 36 different ML models combining these different factors, I was able to produce a working, reliable model using SVM 
and K-means clustering which was capable of real-time analysis (under 700ms) and over 98% accuracy!; A highly impressive achievement with 
regards to similar studies that have been done to develop ML models for analysing road surface condition. 😲

In my repository I have a few examples of models that I developed using the different training factors and algorithms. Please feel free to have a look 😁

The files labelled ".ipynb" are full versions showing each different iteration of the models I trained using different algorithm (XGBoost, Random Forest or SVM + K-means clustering)

The files labelled "Model example" are isolated examples to show a snapshot of how I worked with the different algorithms to classify my data.
